# Sharpe Ratio
# The Sharpe ratio's numerator is the difference over time between realized, or expected, 
# returns and a benchmark such as the risk-free rate of return or the performance of a 
# particular investment category. Its denominator is the standard deviation of returns 
# over the same period of time, a measure of volatility and risk.
